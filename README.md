# Cryptographic Algorithms Toolkit

## Introduction
This Cryptographic Algorithms Toolkit is designed to demonstrate the implementation and application of key cryptographic protocols including RSA, AES in CTR mode, ElGamal encryption, and the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. It serves as an educational tool to understand the principles of cryptography and its applications in secure communication.

## Features
- **RSA Encryption/Decryption**: Implements the RSA algorithm for secure two-way communication, including key generation, message encryption, and decryption.
- **AES in CTR Mode**: Showcases symmetric encryption using AES in Counter mode, suitable for encrypting data streams.
- **ElGamal Encryption**: Provides a detailed implementation of the ElGamal encryption system, demonstrating another approach to asymmetric cryptography.
- **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**: Implements the Diffie-Hellman protocol for secure key exchange, enabling parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.

## Getting Started
To run the toolkit, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and execute the script corresponding to the cryptographic protocol you wish to explore.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyCryptodome library for cryptographic functions (Optional)

## Usage
Each script can be run independently to demonstrate its corresponding cryptographic protocol. The toolkit includes sample messages and keys for testing purposes, but users are encouraged to generate their own keys and messages for a full experience.

## Developer
Developed by Hossein Zare, a dedicated software developer with a focus on cryptography and security. This project is part of an ongoing effort to demystify cryptographic protocols and make them accessible to a broader audience.
